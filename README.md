# Robot Warehouse Coding Test

## Solution

This solution treats the warehouse as a grid itself. Robots utilize the warehouse to move. Robots accept commands 
from the controller which initialize them.

## Installation 

Clone the project from github `https://github.com/J-Kavanagh-Personal/mindful_chef_test.git`

Install ruby 3.0.1 can be found here https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2021/04/05/ruby-3-0-1-released/

## Running the code

Make sure that run.rb is executable this can be done by chmod + x on linux and MacOS systems but on windows you 
might have to set the file properties to be executable in the permissions.
